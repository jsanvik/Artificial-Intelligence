## Written Part
### 1. [40 points]
Consider the problem of finding a path in the grid shown below from the position S to the position G.  
```
 12345678
1--------
2--------
3--G-----
4--XXXXX-
5-X------
6--XS--X-
7--------
8--------
```  
The agent can move on the grid horizontally and vertically, one square at a time (each step has a cost of one).  
No step may be made into a forbidden crossed area. In the case of ties, break it using up, left, right, and down.  
  
**(a) Draw the search tree in a greedy search. Manhattan distance should be used as the heuristic function. That is, h(n) for any node n is the Manhattan distance from n to G. The Manhattan distance between two points is the distance in the x-direction plus the distance in the y-direction. It corresponds to the distance traveled along city streets arranged in a grid. For example, the Manhattan distance between G and S is 4. What is the path that is found by the greedy search?**  
NOTE: Ties were broken **based on direction**, in the following order: up, left, right, down. If there was still a tie (two nodes with the same cost and same direction), the **shallowest node** was expanded first (to find the optimal (least costly) solution).  
  
**(b) Draw the search tree in an A∗ search. Manhattan distance should be used as the heuristic function. What is the path that is found by the A∗ search?**   

### 2. [40 points]  
Consider the following game tree in which the static scores are all from the first player’s point of view:  
![](a2q2tree.png)  
**(a) Suppose the first player is the maximizing player. What move should be chosen?**  

**(b) What nodes would not need to be examined using the alpha-beta pruning procedure?**  

**(c) Suppose now the first player is the minimizing player. What move should be chosen?**  

**(d) What nodes would not need to be examined using the alpha-beta pruning procedure?**  


## Programming Part
### 1. [60 points]  
You are given a grid similar to the one above. You may prompt the user to enter the width and the height of the grid, the start and the goal states, and the forbidden squares.  
Manhattan distance should be used as the heuristic function, and ties are solved using up, left, right, and down.  
Implement each of the following searches and show the solutions:  
**(a) Greedy search from S to G.**  
  
**(b) A∗ search from S to G.**  
  
**(c) UCS search from S to G.**
